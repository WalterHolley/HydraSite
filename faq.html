         <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1></br>
		 <dl>
			<dt><strong>Is Slay Hydra free to play?</strong></dt>
			<dd>Yes.</dd></br>
			<dt><strong>How can I play Slay Hydra?</strong></dt>
			<dd>Just click the "Play Game" button on the home page.</dd></br>
			<dt><strong>Why is it so difficult to beat Hydra?</strong></dt>
			<dd>You can play Slay Hydra on Easy Mode, Medium Mode, or Hard Mode.</dd></br>
			<dt><strong>What is the minimum age required to play Slay Hydra?</strong></dt>
			<dd>Slay Hydra is designed for children aged 12-14, but it is suitable for all ages.</dd></br>
			<dt><strong>How is the game played?</strong></dt>
			<dd>After beginning the game the player will be 
				asked which difficulty they would like to play on. After this the first round will start. Each 
				round the player and Hydra will start by picking their move sequences. The winner of the
				round will be displayed. If the player beats Hydra for that round, the player gets
				to choose whether to heal or attack. Healing will increase the player's health. 
				Attacking will decrease the Hydra's health. Then the round will end and a new 
				round is started. This repeats until either the player or the hydra runs out of health.</dd></br>
			<dt><strong>What is the math behind the game?</strong></dt>
			<dd>Slay Hydra is based on the classic game of probability, the Three Penny Game.
				The Three-Penny Game can be used to demonstrate the probability of sequences of 
				coin tosses. The idea is that whichever sequence of coin tosses Player 1 chooses, 
				Player 2 can choose a sequence more likely to be tossed. In the Slay Hydra version of the game, 
				each player chooses a sequence of 3 moves(right or left). The computer then generates 
				a 3 move series for the monster. Finally, the computer generates a series of random moves until 
				the player or monster gets a combination that matches what they’ve selected. Whoever's
				sequence is first matched by the computer's random right/left move sequence wins the round.</dd></br>
			<dt><strong>What's the trick to beating Hydra in this game of probability?</strong></dt>
			<dd>When the game is in hard mode, Hydra has a greater probability of winning because it 
				understands how to choose a sequence which is more likely to occur before the player’s 
				sequence. For example, let’s say the player chooses the sequence HHH. The sequence 
				HHH must be preceded by a T, unless HHH is the first sequence tossed by the 
				computer. Hydra will use this knowledge to pick the sequence THH. Once the sequence 
				THH turns up, the game is over and Hydra has won. There are no more coin tosses, so 
				HHH will never occur. In other words, Hydra will use the knowledge that THH will 
				always occur before HHH, unless HHH are the first 3 coins tossed. The probability that 
				any sequence of 3 coin tosses will occur is 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.125, or ⅛. Hydra’s 
				probability of beating the player’s sequence, HHH, with the better sequence, THH, is ⅞,
				or 87.5%.</dd>
